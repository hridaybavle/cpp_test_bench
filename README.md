# CPP Test Bench

This repo contains simple examples to test CPP codes without a need to write CMakeLists. 

## Example

1. Run the following command to build the code

    ``` g++ test_shared_pointer_creation.cpp -l pthread ```

2. The command will generate a `a.out` file which can be executed as:

    ``` ./a.out ```
